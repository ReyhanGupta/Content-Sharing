# Crawlers Setup: The asterisk means that the robots.txt file applies to all web robots that visit the site.

Disallow: /admin_messages.php/

Noindex: /admin_messages.php/
#Theoretically, you could disallow a page, but it could still end up in the index.Generally, you don’t want that.
#That’s why you need the noindex directive. It works with the disallow directive to make sure bots don’t visit or index certain pages.

#In short, it tells web robots to not crawl the links on a page.
